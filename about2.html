            <img src="assets/images/contact.jpg" width="250" class="auth-image" alt="family picture">

            <p>I am married with a 2 year old daughter and another on the way. I feel blessed to have all that I have
                in life and that I have opportunities before me.</p><br>

            <p>My interest in writing code is not to start a new career or advance in a position as I am self employed
                and do very well. My desire to learn to code is rooted in the realization that all of the programs that
                exist in my industry are inadequate to work at my pace. I have ideas that would make work more efficient and productive. I belive that I can turn 30
                minute tasks into 3 minute tasks. This is powerful in my industry.</p><br>

            <p>With my busy schedule and a growing family finding time is always a struggle. No matter what at the end of
                this course I will have learned enough to not only continue my journey but to realize my goal of
                creating software for my industry.</p>
